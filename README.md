    The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
    First player plays with X, second one plays with O.
    Players take turns putting their symbols in empty squares.
    The first player to get 3 of her symbols in a row
    (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
    When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

  Because of my poor coding skills, you won't be able to directly enter the
  name of the square you want to fill (i.e A1,C3...) but the position of the
  square from 1 to 9 (e.g. A1 = 1, C3 = 9). Thanks for reading, and I hope
  you'll enjoy playing! Peace
